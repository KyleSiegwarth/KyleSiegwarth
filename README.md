- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kyle
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in open source projects revolving around Cyber security and tools that help members in their forensic journeys
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing Python, C#, and whatever I'm fancying at the time.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: For now through Github is the best way but I doubt anyone will be trying to do that any time soon.
